### Installation

```
sudo apt-get install git
sudo git clone https://github.com/UAVmatrix/UAVcast.git
cd UAVcast/Install
sudo ./Install.sh
```

##How it works
UAVcast uses regular software such as wvdial, inadyn. gstreamer, uqmi, and will fire up each program in the correct order users has defined in the DroneConfig.cfg file. 
 
After you have successfully installed UAVcast and edited DroneConfig, you could simply start UAVcast by running ``` ./DroneStart.sh ``` or ``` sudo systemctl start UAVcast ```
If there is any problems during startup, then please check the logfile located in the ```UAVcast/log ``` category.
 
 
##Configuration
 
``` 
UAVcast/DroneConfig.cfg

This file conatins the configuration parameters for UAVcast scripts. Simply set your desired options and save the file.

##UAVcast Usage

```
Start
sudo systemctl start UAVcast

Stop
sudo systemctl stop UAVcast

Restart
sudo systemctl restart UAVcast

Start on boot 
sudo systemctl enable UAVcast

Not run on boot (for troubleshooting or other tasks)
sudo systemctl disable UAVcast

```
 

##Troubleshooting

Start ```UAVcast/DroneStart.sh ``` if you want a more verbose output of what exactly going on when UAVcast is started.
Also check the logfiles located in the /UAVcast/log folder.


If you are using PiCam, remember to enable the camera in ```Raspi-Config```
